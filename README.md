This module goes hand-in-hand with [residue-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/residue). You must have [C++ library](https://github.com/amrayn/residue-cpp) already installed on the system.

## Requirements

 * Node 7+

## Install
First, you need to install libresidue binary (dynamic)

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amrayn/residue-cpp/master/install.sh)"
```

Once dynamic library is available you can install the package, that will eventually build the native module.

```
npm install --save residue-native
```

## API
Please see [Native Binding](https://github.com/amrayn/residue-node/blob/master/README.md#native-binding) section for API and usage.
